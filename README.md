# Budge maker

## About
this is a budget maker, it is simple it just takes in your monthly salary and makes a split of how much money you have for categories 🙂
It was so fun to make I have to thank my friends for introducing me to Java. The languages is kind of long to write but it seems fine. and from what I seen I'm sure Ill be able to handle everything it throws at me right?
Though I did hear them laughing a bit while I was coding and they were teaching me, I must have made a embarassing mistake while coding. But they assured me it only gets easier from here 😄. I am starting to love programming this is so fun.

## What I used
- Java
- Visual Studio Code

## How to run
Once more it is a program to run in terminal only 😅 I do apologize I will have to learn how to make a better...front end I believe is what the others called it? But one day I will learn how to do that. First Ill focus on mastering everything my friends throw at me
